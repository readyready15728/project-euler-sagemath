# Project Euler (with) SageMath
## Project Euler solutions using SageMath

I am using SageMath on Project Euler problems so as to permit me to be as lazy
as possible.

But no, for real, I wanted to learn how to use this great tool and eventually
I plan on redoing them in Pharo, which lacks a full CAS like SageMath. Doing
this will show me which algorithms and data structures to focus on and I may
one day contribute code I write to Pharo's PolyMath project.
